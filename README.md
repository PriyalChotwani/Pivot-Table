## About Microsoft Excel Pivot Table

Excel Pivot Tables are used for slicing and dicing data which creates crosstab called as cross tabulated structure. It is a user-friendly and interactive way of analyzing large data by summarizing it as per the requirements into categories and sub-categories and discovering the unknown trends in large data. It can be used to simplify the process by providing the flexibility of aggregating numeric data and creating custom calculations and formulas. It can be transposed by swapping the axes; hence it’s called pivot. I chose this tool to include in my portfolio as to be a data analyst, it is very important to learn how to modify and store the data in excel sheets and this tool plays a very important role in terms of data manipulation.

## Dataset and Research questions

The dataset used for this research is of size 3.6MB and it contains 18 columns. Excel Pivot table will be used to analyze the dataset provided in Chapter 1 in class which is the sales data for the fictious company, GBI. The data selected for the pivot table will be changed to answer different questions, therefore different columns will be selected accordingly. For this study, no data cleaning is necessary. Although, there are few missing values in the dataset, but for simplicity, the missing values are not discarded. We will be discovering the revenue trends and sales distribution across Germany and US. Following are the research questions that will be answered:

 - What is the average revenue per customer per year per division?
 - Are the historical (year by year) revenue trends for the US and DE similar or dissimilar?
 - Is there seasonality in revenue during the year? If so, what month has the highest revenue? Is the seasonality similar from year to year?
 - What was the distribution of net sales of different product category for Germany and USA? Which country has more overall net sales throughout?
 - What is the revenue distribution of different materials across different countries?

## Applying the Analytical Tool and Results

##### Question 1: What is the average revenue per customer per year per division?
The figure shows the average revenue for each customer in each year per division. According to Figure, Bavaria Bikes have the highest average revenue in the year 2007 for the division BI as compared to AS. The second customer on the list of highest average revenue is Silicon Valley Bikes. This is a crucial analysis to know about the customers and which customers are the major contributing factor in the revenue distribution.

##### Question 2: Are the historical (year by year) revenue trends for the US and DE similar or dissimilar?
Figure shows a line graph where x-axis represents several years and y-axis depicts the revenue, while the color represents 2 countries that are Germany and US. The revenue trend for the US and Germany is dissimilar as shown in Figure suggesting that over the years the revenue for US has been falling till 2009, after which it remained almost constant. Whereas, in case of Germany, the revenue has been following an upward trend. Overall, the revenue for Germany has been higher in comparison to the US.

##### Question 3: Is there seasonality in revenue during the year? If so, what month has the highest revenue? Is the seasonality similar from year to year?
Yes, there is a seasonality in revenue during the year. Figure shows a line graph where x-axis depicts the months January being 1 and y-axis depicts the revenue, and several colors represent different years. From the graph, it is visible that the revenue seems to be the highest during the mid of the year i.e., June and it follows the same trend from year to year.

##### Question 4: What was the distribution of net sales of different product category for Germany and USA? Which country has more overall net sales throughout?
Following table suggests that grand total of sum of net sales for Germany is higher than United States, also TOU has highest net sales in both the countries. This is also represented in Figure via a bar graph where x-axis shows the product category and y-axis shows the sum of net sales for Germany in blue color and United States in orange color. The lowest net sales are for TRE both in Germany and US.

##### Question 5: What is the revenue generated from top 10 materials across USA and Germany?
Following table shows the revenue generated from top 10 materials across US and Germany in a tabular format. The data is sorted in a descending order, and it shows that Professional Road Bike has the highest revenue in both the countries, whereas Men’s Off-Road Bike Fully, and Professional Touring Bike(silver) are 2nd and 3rd respectively. Profession Touring bike (red) is the last item on the list for Germany and Women’s off-road bike fully is the last item for the USA. Overall, Germany has the highest revenue in comparison to the US for all materials without any exception. This is also depicted using a bar graph in Figure where x-axis represents all the materials and y-axis represents the revenue for the US (shown orange color) and Germany (shown in blue color).

## Analysis and Critique of the Tool

Excel is a tool which have many functionalities and pivot tables are one of them. These are the great of analysing a chunk of data from huge data. This is still widely used in various companies, and I decided to include this tool in my portfolio as this is one of the tools that will never go out of fashion.

Pivot tables has many strengths, and I would start by its ease to use. It can simply be created by selecting a chunk of data and clicking on the Insert Pivot Table button in excel. It is a very flexible tool and provides a user-friendly way of sorting, filtering, and re-ordering the information in a summarized format. Also, it is quite easy to create graphs in Excel using the chunk of the data selected for the analysis. The graphs are very easy to create and understand the overall answers that are being looked for.

## Conclusion:

Excel has been in use since several years and it has been adding onto its functionalities of handling the data. As shown in the exercises above, we were able to find out the average revenue distribution and sum of net sales for Germany and Unites States, while analysing about different customers and product categories. This is a great tool for working with spreadsheets and provide various functionalities that can not only be used to modify or transform the data, but it can also be used to analyse the data through various types of charts. I would recommend this tool to someone who enjoys working on spreadsheets and don’t want to go deep into the technical languages to get the job done.
